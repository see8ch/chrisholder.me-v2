				<h2>Over 16th</h2>
				<h4>A new experience for downtown Denver.</h4>
				
				<p>The landmark Union Station in Denver, which once served as the major transportation hub for the city, was recently chosen for a large scale upgrade that would restructure another Denver landmark, 16th Street Mall.</p>
	
				<p>Our team's project was to develop a plan to increase foot traffic on 16th Street and help establish more of a culture around the landmark for tourists and locals.</p>

				<h3 class="subhead">The Future of Union Station</h3>
				<p>"Denver Union Station is a unique project that will bring together many different transportation modes, along with new private development, to create a new bustling urban center and multimodal transportation hub.  Denver Union Station will be the heartbeat of activity in the city and the centerpiece of a new age of connectivity in the region."</p>

				<p>The highlight of 16th Street Mall is the Millenium Bridge that connects downtown to the Platte Park and Highlands neighborhoods.	We surveyed quite a few tourists and found that Millenium Bridge, or the "sail boat", was one of the most iconic images of downtown Denver they took with them. The problem with the bridge is, as 16th Street becomes more and more cluttered with mismatched wayfinding, transportation and retail signage, the bridge becomes less and less visible and less of a destination spot.</p>

				<p>With the upcoming development in the area, we wanted to ensure Millenium Bridge was able to retain it's image and promote foot traffic near the end of the 16th Street Mall, where there is a lack of retail shopping.</p>

				<p>We chose to create a destination building/experience that would help connect the Millenium Bridge, 16th Street Mall and the new Union Station. The building would act as a hub for locals and a place for tourists to relax once they arrive at Union Station or prior to departing.</p> 

				<p>Given the development projects in the area and the iconic elements of the Millenium Bridge, our team wanted to create a building that would blend into and highlight the new environment while complimenting the design elements that made each landmark special.</p>

				<div class="overrenderp">
					<p>One thing that 16th Street Mall has been missing, is a viewing area or place to take in the entirety of the mall. For our building, we wanted to provide a destination that would give visitors a overview of 16th Street but not impede foot traffic in any way. The solution was desiging a balcony the hung over the street and was supported by cables, similar to Millenium Bridge.</p>

					<p>The organic building shape was used to accomplish two things, break up the hard edged glass lines of the buildings in development and use the space more efficiently. By placing a large balcony over 16th Street, it would also help entice mall patrons to visit the non-retail end of the street and create a visual stepping stone for the Millenium Bridge.</p>

			<p class="caption">Over 16th Logo</p>

			<p>The branding for Over borrowed from the building's shape, materials and multiple levels to create a simple, iconic mark that lended itself to adaptability. Since the building was an attraction and would house many retailers, event spaces and outdoor festivals, a few example sub-brands were created. The sub-brands played with the name of the building itself to help create an inclusive experience.</p>

			
			<h3 class="subhead">Sub-Brands</h3>
			<p>Some examples for these sub-brands were: Over Easy, a breakfast and coffee restaurant, Over Night, a nightclub/lounge on the upper level and Over Grown, a local farmers market that would help bridge the gap for many downtown residents without easy access to a grocery store.</p>
